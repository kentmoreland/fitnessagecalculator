            <h1>About Fitness Age Calculator</h1>

            <p>Fitness Age Calculator is a free online tool that helps you understand where your strength levels stand relative to your age and body weight. Whether you're just starting your fitness journey or you've been lifting for years, our calculator gives you personalized strength goals and a "fitness age" score to keep you motivated.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We believe that strength training is one of the best things you can do for your long-term health. Research consistently shows that maintaining muscle strength is associated with better quality of life, reduced injury risk, and healthier aging. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to understand their current fitness level and set meaningful, achievable strength goals.</p>

            <h2>How the Calculator Works</h2>
            <p>Our calculator uses two main features:</p>

            <h2>Strength Goals</h2>
            <p>Based on your gender, age, and body weight, we calculate personalized strength targets across four levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> Achievable within the first few months of consistent training</li>
                <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Typically reached after 1-2 years of dedicated training</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Requires several years of serious, structured training</li>
                <li><strong>Elite:</strong> Top-tier strength that very few lifters achieve</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These goals are calculated using bodyweight multipliers derived from widely recognized strength standards used across the fitness community. The multipliers differ for men and women to reflect physiological differences in strength potential.</p>

            <h2>Fitness Age</h2>
            <p>If you know your current one-rep max (1RM) for bench press, squat, and deadlift, our calculator estimates your "fitness age" -- the age group your strength most closely matches. A fitness age younger than your actual age means you're stronger than average for your age group. A higher fitness age suggests room for improvement.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>The fitness age calculation uses strength-to-bodyweight ratios mapped against age-adjusted standards. Your score is the average fitness age across all three lifts, giving you a balanced view of your overall strength.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Our Standards</h2>
            <p>The strength standards used in our calculator are based on bodyweight ratio multipliers that are commonly referenced in the strength training community. These ratios account for the well-documented relationship between bodyweight and strength potential. While individual results will always vary based on factors like training history, genetics, limb proportions, and overall health, these standards provide a useful benchmark for the general population.</p>

            <h2>Important Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Fitness Age Calculator is designed for informational and entertainment purposes. The results are estimates based on general population averages and should not be taken as medical or professional fitness advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider or certified personal trainer before starting or modifying an exercise program.</p>
